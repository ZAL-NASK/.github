# Department of Linear Algebra (and beyond!)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Department of Linear Algebra at NASK (Polish National Research Institute)! 🌐 This repository houses our projects, research papers, and tools related to matrix factorization, neural network compression and mathematical fundamentals of machine learning. 🚀

## About Us

Our department is dedicated to exploring and harnessing the power of mathematics, particularly linear algebra, in real-life applications. We want mathematics to explain the world around us and dive into various (trendy or not!) problems by applying rigorous mathematical methods. Moreover, we want our code to be usable and our research understandable to a wide audience - the key is simplicity and elegance, and not the complexity of our work. Our research finds applications in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and statistics. 📚🧠💻 

## Projects

Here we will describe each of our published projects.

## Research Papers

Our department actively contributes to the scientific community through research papers published in top-tier conferences and journals. In this section, we will list the papers we are proud of the most. 📝🔬🌐

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance our projects and advance the field. If you are interested in contributing, please follow our guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file of each project repository. 🙌🔧📝
